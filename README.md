🚀 Deploying Kubernetes on GCP with Terraform & GitHub CI/CD 🌐
✨ Infrastructure as Code, Automated Deployments, and Scalable Cloud Solutions! ✨

🔧 What We Built:

    A fully automated pipeline to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform and GitHub Actions.

    🛠️ Infrastructure as Code: Terraform scripts to provision GKE clusters, compute resources, and load balancers.

    🤖 CI/CD Automation: GitHub Actions for seamless, secure, and repeatable deployments.

    🚦 Scalable & Secure: Kubernetes deployments with static IPs, workload identity federation, and role-based access control.

🌟 Key Features:

    ☁️ GCP Integration: Leveraged GKE, Compute Engine, and Cloud Storage for a robust cloud infrastructure.

    🔐 Secure Authentication: GitHub OIDC with GCP Workload Identity Federation for secure, tokenless access.

    ⚙️ Terraform Magic: Infrastructure defined as code for consistency and reproducibility.

    🚀 CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing, planning, and deployment with GitHub Actions.

    📦 Kubernetes Deployment: Containerized applications managed effortlessly with GKE.

💡 Why It’s Awesome:

    🛡️ Security First: OIDC authentication ensures no long-lived credentials are stored.

    ⏩ Speed & Efficiency: Automated pipelines reduce manual errors and deployment time.

    🌍 Scalability: Kubernetes and GKE enable horizontal scaling for high-traffic applications.

    🔄 Reproducibility: Terraform ensures the same infrastructure can be deployed across environments.

🔗 Tech Stack:

    Cloud: GCP (GKE, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage)

    IaC: Terraform

    CI/CD: GitHub Actions

    Orchestration: Kubernetes

    Authentication: GitHub OIDC + GCP Workload Identity Federation

🌈 The Future:

    📊 Monitoring: Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for real-time insights.

    🔄 Multi-Environment Support: Staging, production, and rollback strategies.

    🛠️ Advanced Networking: Implement ingress controllers and network policies.

🎯 Impact:
This project demonstrates how to build a modern, scalable, and secure cloud-native infrastructure using cutting-edge tools and best practices. Perfect for DevOps engineers, cloud enthusiasts, and anyone passionate about automation! 🚀
